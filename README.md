# SumUP extension 

An intuitive browser extension that brings the power of AI directly to your fingertips. Designed to simplify workflows and enhance productivity, this extension offers multiple AI-powered tools, including Prompt API, Summarize Text, Translate Text, and more!

## Features

1. **Prompt API**  
   Generate creative responses or ideas by inputting your custom prompts.

2. **Summarize Text**  
   Create summaries from lengthy content using various styles such as key points, TL;DR, teasers, and headlines.

3. **Translate Text**  
   Translate text to and from supported languages like English, Spanish, and Japanese. Choose translation sources, including manual input, previous prompts, or summarized outputs.

4. **Write API**  
   Generate tailored content based on a given context or prompt. The API adapts to various scenarios, such as creative writing or formal compositions.

5. **Rewrite API**  
   Improve or modify existing text by adjusting tone (e.g., formal or casual) and length (e.g., longer or shorter).


## How It Works

1. Select a feature from the main interface (e.g., Prompt, Summarize, Translate, etc.).  
2. Input your text or provide context for the API to process.  
3. Configure additional settings or parameters if required (e.g., tone, length, or output format).  
4. Submit and view the AI-generated output in real-time.

## Technology Stack  

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Used for creating the user interface.  
- **Browser Extension APIs**: For smooth and seamless integration into the browser.  
- **AI APIs**: Powering language processing, summarization, translation, and rewriting features.  

## Challenges Faced  

- **Getting comfortable with JavaScript**: JS is not my primary coding language so I needed to do some relearning.
- **DOMException bugs**: Due to time constraints and personal lack of skill, I was not able to fully debug this bug. 
- **Quality Issues in Writer API**: The text generation occasionally lacked coherence and contextual relevance.  

## Future Improvements  

- Improve the integration of Rewriter API to function properly.  
- Make the extension more intuitive and user-friendly and nicer looking lol.  
- Implement more features especially integrating the Detect API and Translate API to allow multi-language prompting.
