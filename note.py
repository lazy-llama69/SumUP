Features to be implemented:

Done:
-Prompt 
-Summarising
-Translate 
-Write and rewrite 
-Clear text and session for each api
-Translate Language from prompt
-Translate language from summary
-Rewrite response from prompt and summary
-Improve UI 

Things to note about:
1. Detect API is very clunky and only works in the console for some reason. 
2. Spanish language cannot translate to Japanese or vice versa.
3. Write API sometimes gives DOM exception when given a prompt which may not be suitable
4. Rewrite API with the same problem.
